## 🧠 Project Objective

To build a lightweight, custom simulation of React’s rendering mechanism to understand:

- How JSX translates to `React.createElement`
- How virtual DOM elements are constructed as plain JavaScript objects
- How these elements are rendered into the real DOM
- Why React doesn’t use standard DOM manipulation

---

## 📁 Project Structure

### `/index.html`
A minimal HTML file that links the JavaScript files and contains a root container.

### `/customScript.js`
This file demonstrates how to manually render HTML using JS objects and a custom render function.

### `/reactScript.js`
This file uses actual React syntax and the `React.createElement` API to render elements to the DOM.
